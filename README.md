# Audio-Captcha-Generator

This code snippet creates an audio CAPTCHA using the captcha library. It first generates a random 6-digit number, then uses the AudioCaptcha class to create an audio file that reads out this number. This audio file is saved as an MP3 file with the same name as the number. Finally, the script prints the CAPTCHA value (the random number) to the console. This can be useful for creating auditory challenges in CAPTCHA verification systems, often used to prevent automated bots from accessing certain features or services.
